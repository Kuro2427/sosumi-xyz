Paste this snippet where you want the widget to show up on your site:

<div id='computering'>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://kurosroom.nekoweb.org/computering/onionring-variables.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://kurosroom.nekoweb.org/computering/onionring-widget.js"></script>
</div>

Style it to your liking with this boilerplate CSS; There's no "official" look to it, so feel free to get creative with it as long as it's still legible.

/* this file affects the style of the widget. remember to replace all instances of #computering with whatever value you have for ringID in the onionring-widget.js file. make sure it still has the # at the front, though! probably easiest to use find+replace to do it */

#computering {
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 15px; /* creates some space around the widget */
}

#computering table {
  background-color: #ffffff; /* makes the background pure white */
  margin: 0 auto; /* centers the widget */
}

#computering table tr td {
  padding: 15px; /* creates some space between the links and text inside the widget */
}
