![sosumi's "webbed site" (on the inter net)](https://f.elisttm.space/f/Kuro/Random_uploads/ghlogo.png)

Hello, this is the repository for my site, [sosumi.xyz.](https://sosumi.xyz)

sosumi.xyz is hosted on [Nekoweb.](https://nekoweb.org/) 
The commits pushed here get automatically synced thanks to [this awesome action.](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-nekoweb)

This repo exists publicly entirely just because the action calls for it, but if you'd like to make something cool for the site, be my guest and make a PR! Just be advised that:

1. It might be a while until I notice the pull request (maybe dm me on discord @sosumi.xyz to let me know?)
2. My code is an actual ungodly mess
