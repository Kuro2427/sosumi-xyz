<h1> (Journal) The Day Kuro Became Sosumi</h1>
<h4>16 May 2025</h4>
<p></p>
<p>I've never been great with usernames.</p>
<p>At my very first shot at starting an online presence of my own, when I was about 10 and coming fresh off of Facebook, I ended up breaking basically the biggest unspoken rule of being on-line as a child, and wound up using my full, real name, or, well, a variation thereof. And thus, I spent many years of my life signing up to all sorts of websites - including ones that in hindsight no child should have been visiting - with a username that was only a mild riff on my actual, legal name, and kept my very recognizable surname intact...</p>
<p>It was at some point when I was about 13 or so, I don't remember exactly <em>what</em> I was signing up to, but I remember stopping dead in my tracks whilst filling in a form and just thinking... &quot;This isn't right, is it? Putting my name out in the open like this...&quot; And so, I was in the hunt for a new username, a real one, with nothing to do with my IRL personal information.</p>
<p>Around about that time, I was deep in the retro gaming trenches. Kick started by a particular bootleg PlayStation 2 disc (which is a whole tangent I'd like to elaborate on in a later post) at age 9, by my first year of unmonitored internet access, I could probably recite most top level retro gaming anecdotes off the top of my head. This unquenchable thirst for knowledge quickly lead me to weirder, more obscure works. And back in the early to mid 2010s of course, weird and obscure effectively meant &quot;Japanese&quot;</p>
<p>So throughout my late childhood and early teenage years, I dove head first into the niche, the strange, and the Asian - retro and otherwise. My first ever fursona was based off the characters from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan">OSU! (2005)</a>. There was a point in my life where I could probably list off more Vocaloid voicebanks than capitals in my own country. My computer's locale was <em><strong>PERMANENTLY</strong></em> set to Japanese so I wouldn't run into any issues trying to play whatever janky little RPGMaker horror game I had downloaded off some shady forum that week.</p>
<p>So as I stared at that blinking cursor on like, probably Amino if we're being honest (lol), I typed in &quot;Kuro&quot;</p>
<p>Kuro is a side character seen throughout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doko_Demo_Issyo">Doko Demo Issyo</a> franchise. A Japan-only series of games that hinged on teaching new words to a cute cat character named Toro Inoue (whose face you've more than likely seen plastered all over platforms like our dear nekoweb). These games proved to be quite popular in their country of origin. Popular enough to make Toro and his friends into &quot;unofficial mascots&quot; of sorts to Playstation as a whole in a sort of Sackboyian, Astrobot kind of way. And to me back then, since people rarely discussed these games past a general acknowledgement that they exist, these characters were effectively just that. Cute mascots with no real depth or even personality in my eyes. So, on a whim, when I wanted something new to go by, the first character that popped into my mind to name myself after, not out of a sense of genuine connection or anything, was Kuro.</p>
<p>Now, the issue is... Kuro isn't exactly the most unique username on Earth, is it?</p>
<p>I of course didn't know this back then either, but &quot;Kuro&quot; is literally just the Japanese word for black. Thus, many, MANY characters are named after it, and it's also just... a very common username to pick apparently. Even back then, after trying to sign up as just &quot;Kuro&quot;, I was met with a &quot;username already taken&quot; error, thus making me choose something else to tack onto it, and me, in my infinite 13 year old wisdom ended up choosing &quot;2427&quot;. A completely random string of four digits that just happened to sound good together. I mean, at least I took <em>that</em> into consideration, right?</p>
<p>Then, bizarrely enough, likely just due to sheer long term exposure, the name stuck. I set it as my username everywhere and it felt... Good! I liked being Kuro, having no real link to who I was in real life. I suppose that's why I never even considered changing it, even if at one point I realized how generic of a name it was to go by, and how in reality, Kuro's personality didn't match my own AT ALL WHATSOEVER (a violently homosexual man vs a total womanizer), I still stuck by that name.</p>
<p>That started to shift around early 2025. I don't remember exactly when the topic first came up, likely due to us running into another Kuro, but some of my friends started to point out how... Kind of terrible of a username &quot;Kuro&quot; is, and to be honest... They were right.</p>
<p>So, I started brainstorming names. At first, I had thought of naming myself after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Smithee">Alan Smithee</a>, a pseudonym used by Hollywood directors of old to distance themselves from projects where they weren't able to fully exercise their creative vision. I played with multiple variations on the name such as &quot;aransumi&quot; (Alan Smithee, abbreviated and transliterated into Japanese) and &quot;aransumi4&quot; (likewise, but with a 4 acting as the &quot;shi&quot; in &quot;aran sumiishi&quot;), but none of those felt really &quot;me&quot;.</p>
<p>These thoughts bounced around my head restlessly like the marble in a spray paint can as I still struggled to come up with better name ideas for some reason, particularly the &quot;sumi&quot; part, what one of my friends proposed my shortened nickname would be, ringed deep in my brain, it just reminded me of... Something.</p>
<p>As I laid in bed one night, almost falling asleep, I suddenly jolted awake when it all clicked together...</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosumi">SOSUMI!</a></h2>
<p>I quickly opened my phone and typed out a half asleep message to my partner, asking what she thought of me going by &quot;sosumi&quot;, at least publicly, from now on.</p>
<p>Sosumi is the name of the error sound used by Apple computers starting from Macintosh System 7. The vaguely Japanese sounding name is actually derived from the phrase &quot;so, sue me!&quot; as said by Jim Reekes, the creator of the sound when Apple's legal team stated that he couldn't call it &quot;Let It Beep&quot;, a pun on The Beatles song &quot;Let it be&quot;, due to the fact the company had run into issues with Apple Corp Inc. over the name similarity in the past.</p>
<p>Sosumi was perfect. It was short, snappy, memorable, and not only had to do with old computers, but classic Macs! The whole thing I had styled my website loosely after! It was honestly too good to be true. I quickly snagged the sosumi.xyz domain (for cheap, too!), and the rest as they say, is history.</p>
<p>Part of me still hasn't gotten used to this new name. I strongly believe there will be a mild to strong sense of confusion the first time someone previously unfamiliar with me calls me &quot;sumi&quot; or &quot;sosumi&quot;, but I suppose that's just how it is to suddenly make such a big change to your public facing identity out of the blue like this.</p>
<p>I suppose it only makes me respect trans people more than I already did before...</p>
