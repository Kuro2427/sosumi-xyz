    <p>Tired of social media but can't stop posting? Statuses just don't feel the same? Check out...</p>
    <h1>sloggr!</h1> 

    <iframe src="sample.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>sloggr is a microblogging tool that is fully compatible with static web hosts. Useful for sharing quick updates, shower thoughts, <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blogposting">blogposting</a> of all sorts, really.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Slogs as a concept actually predate sloggr itself by almost a whole year, I started using them to get away from social media. Any time I had the urge to post something, I just added it to a little scrollable div on my website instead, bt that quickly proved to be too cumbersome as my site grew, so, inspired by <a href="https://drawbox.nekoweb.org/">the drawbox project</a>, I made this funky little script to make slogging easier than ever.</p>

    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>Through the power of using Google's suite for dubious purposes! Like any good programmer has done at least once.</p>

    <h2>And what's with the name?</h2>
    <p>sloggr comes from "slog", as mentioned above, and slog is a portmanteau of "short" and "log" therefore, a short log! ... It's a shitty name, I know, I use it half ironically myself, you can call it whatever you want, honestly.</p>

    <h2>How to use</h2>

    <p>Setting up sloggr is a shockingly easy process, all you need to get it up and running is a google account, and once you're done, you're pretty much set! Basically all you have to do is...</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Create a new blank <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/">google form</a>. Feel free to set the title and description to whatever you want, this will not be publicly accessible.</li>
        <li>Change the default question to "paragraph" (or "short answer" if you want a smaller word limit, either one works)</li>
        <li>Click the big purple "publish" button.</li>
        <li>Change the form's responder setting from "anyone with the link" to "restricted". If you ignore this step, anyone who inspects your site's source code <b><i>WILL</i></b> be able to make public posts very easily.</li>
        <li>Copy your form's responder link an keep it somewhere easy to access. This is how you will make all of your posts.</li>
        <li>Tab over to the "responses" section and click "link to sheets".</li>
        <li>Select "create a new spreadsheet" and click "create". A new window will open with your newly created responses spreadsheet, this sheet is also where you will be able to manage, edit and delete all of your posts.</li>
        <li>Click on the share button, and change the "general access" permission to "anyone with the link". Make sure the role is set to "viewer", or else much like in step 4 anyone will be able to edit your posts.</li>
        <li>Download <a href="view-source:kuros-room.nekoweb.org/sloggr/sloggr.html">sloggr.html</a> and place it in your website's directory and open it in your text editor of choice.</li>
        <li>Change the "sheetId" constant to your spreadsheet's ID, which is literally just the long string of characters after /d/and before /edit in  the URL you are at when editing yor sheet. E.G: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<b><u>1ztRsiAWRhyuiHznP5L4iA-omwV3G2mkepgqFOAFjLrA</u></b>/edit</li>
        <li>Add an iframe that links to sloggr.html on your website and you're done! You can now freely post to your heart's content!</li>
    </ol>
