        <p>Thank you for checking out this page. Here you'll find info, refs and featured drawings of my OCs, all of which are just my previous fursonas lol.</p>
        <p>I'm generally pretty lax as to how these characters are portrayed, but to avoid any confusion, refer to the table below:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>

                <td>Fan works (drawings, comics, fanfiction, etc.)</td><td>Please do!</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Adult / NSFW fan works</td><td>Unless the character is stated to be underage, please do! And don't be afraid to send it to me!</td>
            </tr>

        <p>Kanae is the sole surviving prototype of a then aspiring series of companion robots designed by _DATAMISSNG���.</p>
        <p>Not only does he use a complex self-training neural network to continuously improve his capabilities even despite his underpowered processor, his highly experimental power source, the Firecore, allows him to feel human-like emotions.</p>
        <p>His current and only directive is to love and aid humans by any means necessary, thus making him a selfless and gentle - if a bit reckless - individual.</p>

        <p>Roland is a Christmas-obsessed reindeer. During the month of december he's a bundle of joy (and sticks, lol), but during the other 11 months of the year, he's far more reserved and dresses with a much more reserved, darker look.</p>
        <p>He's a photographer and a major tech nerd, some of his interests include amateur radio and signal identification. He's the type of guy who sleeps to a UVB-76 feed every night.</p>
        <p>He was my main fursona for about one month, in december 2023, but I just couldn't make him work in the non-holiday months, so he ended up getting shelved pretty quick, even for my standards.</p>

        <p>Haruo is an East Asian Jackalope, a species that I just sorta made the hell up (much like base jackalopes, I suppose)</p>
        <p>There is not much to say about him as he was designed to be a sort of "blank slate" character, like most of the fursonas I make until I inevitably give them too much personality and they end up being downgraded (or is it upgraded) to ocs.</p>
        <p>If I had to give him a personality on the spot, I'd say that despite his stern, straight-faced looks, he's into all sorts of mildly-embarrassing nerdy interests. He probably has a pretty stacked gunpla shelf...</p>

        <p>He has no art <br> He has no lore <br> This fur-sona <br> Is quite the bore!</p>
        <p>All jokes aside, James is based off a series of playermodels I've used in multiple sandbox and social games. When I first started playing Tower Unite, I picked a Lycanroc as my avatar, and ended up growing attached to it. Eventually once I started getting more into VRChat, I made a slight edit to <a href="https://chaoticjay.gumroad.com/l/rvudkr">ChaoticJay's Alpha Werewolf base</a> (basically just hue shifting it red lol) and grew even MORE attached to that. Eventually I decided to try making a red edit of <a href="https://alber.gumroad.com/l/CoyoteMk2">Alber's Coyote base</a>, and I got so attached to that that I decided to make it my main sona with only some slight edits. So technically I fell victim to not just the Pokésona -> fursona pipeline, but the VRChat base edit -> fursona pipeline with one character...</p>
